🎲 My first Github published "project."

🎲 I put this together in a few minutes, and it has some bugs, but it works mostly.

🎲 It does what it looks like it does. It generates a number between 1 and 6, and tells you which it is.


🎲 I hope that  this will be the start of something great, and one day I'll be able to make projects as cool as some of my older friends at school, 
and after that, at professional-level.

🎲 Sincerely, vivi.
